# Sales Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables in Excel

## Project Overview
This project showcases my proficiency in Excel, particularly in the use of Pivot Tables to analyze sales data. The dataset includes information such as sales figures, costs, profits, revenue, gender, country, and state. I created three Pivot Tables to explore the data from different perspectives.

## Pivot Tables Breakdown

### 1. Profit, Cost, and Revenue Summary by Country and State
In this pivot table, the data is summarized by:
- **Country**: Each country is categorized at the top level.
- **State**: Within each country, sales data is further broken down by state.

The following metrics are presented:
- **Profit Total**: The total profit for each country and state.
- **Cost Total**: The total cost for each country and state.
- **Revenue Total**: The total revenue for each country and state.

#### Filter Option:
- **Gender**: The pivot table can be filtered by gender to analyze the distribution of sales by male and female customers for each country and state.

### 2. Profit, Cost, and Revenue Percentage Summary by Country and State
This pivot table summarizes the data by:
- **Country**: Each country is categorized at the top level.
- **State**: Within each country, sales data is further broken down by state.

The following percentage metrics are calculated:
- **Profit Percentage**: The percentage of profit relative to total sales for each state and country.
- **Cost Percentage**: The percentage of cost relative to total sales for each state and country.
- **Revenue Percentage**: The percentage of revenue relative to total sales for each state and country.

#### Filter Option:
- **Gender**: Similar to the first pivot table, this table can be filtered by gender to provide insights into the contribution of male and female customers.

### 3. Yearly Revenue by Country
The third pivot table provides a high-level summary of the total **Revenue** for each country on a yearly basis. This allows for a clear comparison of how each country performs in terms of sales revenue over the years.

## How to Use the Project
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Navigate through the pivot tables to explore the sales data in different ways.
3. Use the filter option to segment the data by gender for more detailed insights.
4. Analyze the yearly performance of each country using the third pivot table.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Pivot Table creation and formatting.
- Data analysis and summarization using Pivot Tables.
- Use of filters for dynamic data exploration.
- Calculation of percentages in Pivot Tables.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of additional filters for deeper analysis (e.g., product type or time period).
- Visualization of key metrics using charts to complement the Pivot Tables.
